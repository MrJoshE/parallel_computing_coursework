## Question 1

#### a. **What is the “>>” operator?**

The “>>” operator is a right bit shift operation that shifts the operands (number to the left of the operator) bits to the right by the number to the right of the operator. Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded.

A single bit shift will half the operand, the number of bit shifts made will cause the operand to half that many times as binary is base 2. 

For example 12 >> 2 will cause a bit shift of 2 shifts to the right, after the single bit shift the 12 would be halfed to 6 then after the second bit shift 6 will half to become 3.

This can be visualised:

0000 1100  = 12

If we shift the bits to the right we will get

0000 0110 = 6

Then when we shift to the right again we will get

0000 0011 = 3

#### b. **Ignoring overheads due to memory access and task communication, calculate the pessimistic and optimistic estimates of overall speedup (up to 2 decimal places) for the case where 75% of the work in a task is sped up by the use of 1000 parallel processors.**



#### c. **Assuming that that a kernel called someKernel has been defined, how many times will it run based on the following invocation: someKernel<<<10, 10>>>()**

The following invocation is configured to run in 10 thread blocks which each have 10 threads and will therefore run 100 times.

#### d. **What is the arithmetic intensity of the matrix multiplication kernel using shared memory (Lab class week 3)?**

#### e. **Assume that we want to use each thread to calculate two (adjacent) elements of a vector addition. What would be the expression for mapping the thread/block indices to i, the data index of the first element to be processed by a thread?**

**I. i=blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x +2;
II. i=blockIdx.x * threadIdx.x * 2
III. i=(blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x)*2
IV. i=blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * 2 + threadIdx.x**
